    <h2> Enter the sandman </h2>
    <p>Say your prayers, little one
        Don't forget, my son
        To include everyone
        Tuck you in, warm within
        Keep you free from sin
        'Til the sandman, he comes
        Sleep with one eye open
        Gripping your pillow tight</p>
    <p> Exit light
        Enter night
        Take my hand
        </p>
    <p> We're off to never-never land
        Somethings wrong, shut the light
        Heavy thoughts tonight
        And they aren't of Snow White
        Dreams of war, dreams of liars
        Dreams of dragon's fire
        And of things that will bite, yeah
        Sleep with one eye open
        Gripping your pillow tight
    </p>
    <p>
        Exit light
        Enter night
        Take my hand
    </p>
    <p> We're off to never-never land
        Now I lay me down to sleep
        Now I lay me down to sleep</p>

    <p>
        I pray the Lord my soul to keep
        I pray the Lord my soul to keep
        If I die before I wake
        If I die before I wake
        I pray the Lord my soul to take
        I pray the Lord my soul toâ€¦
